## GnomesLand is a NFT project in support of the GnoLand blockchain.

Gnomes will spread the values and messages behind GnoLand to get support in our fight against the globalist takeover. Recent years are showing us that people, including many that are into blockchain and crypto are blindly accepting the corporate greed with their political influences.

Many are even bringing the same systems from outside, into blockchain and crypto and become the people they used to hate. It saddens me that people just "accept" it as "normal" and think they can't change this. This is not why most of us got into blockchain and crypto.

We want the globalist system to change, we want us to have a voice, we want to make tools that gives us that voice but more importantly, we want people to believe again that we can make a difference if we unite.

The last generations have been brought up with the idea that critical thinking is not allowed, they told them: “What’s in the books, is the truth, no questions asked". 

Even more generations have noticed that voting makes no difference, it’s the same puppets that keep the power. *We should give people back the confidence that every vote counts in the new system.* We should get the people back around the table and join the discussions, share your input and come to a general consensus where we can all benefit from. It’s not too late yet but there’s not much time left either.

People want to earn money, people need to earn money to live but there should be no place for corporate or personal greed in blockchain or crypto nor in NFT projects.

## GnomesLand NFT’s will spread messages, thoughts and value(s).

We are only 2 designers and an occasional freelancer. This project has been drafted for over a year and we finally found GnoLand is the blockchain that leans very close to our own believes in a new system, both the values of the chain and it’s founder Jae Kwon and the core developers. We are taking it slowly and have been drawing for over 6 months. Gnomes NFT’s will be revealed at first as “comics” with a message to spread the word and make sure people wake up to the truth. Sometimes we will need to look in the mirror and realise that we are also part of some problems. Some might be seen as controversial but we don’t care, we want people to engage, in a polite manner, we want people to discuss the topics and actually think about them. We want to take away the tunnel vision that some people have created by being surrounded by the same kind of people constantly and especially the tunnel vision that has been pushed upon people through social media, where people NEVER get to see anything from another perspective anymore, it’s been proven that algorithms on social media work that way. They divide people!

We can not afford to let the globalists play the “divide and conquer” game anymore, we should not fall for it anymore. We don’t have to look at what we don’t have in common but in what we DO have in common and that’s the fact that we’re being played with in such manner that people are literally going nuts.

## The NFT’s in the Land of Gnomes and their goal.

As mentioned before we’re actually only 2 main artists/designers, OiKeii and my teenage daughter. We love art and don’t want to bring the same kind of randomised NFT’s of a head and some stock accessories to you. We’re working hard to bring something worthwhile to the people. I don’t want to give out to much alpha yet so we will reveal everything in slow motion, starting with simple silhouettes to great cartoons all the way up to the Metaverse.

I can however already tell you that only a small percentage of the potential generated income, will go to the artists. The rest will be split between supporting the GnoLand ecosystem and sponsoring non-profits for people with mental health problems. These non-profit projects will be thoroughly inspected, if they’re already subsidised by the government or others, if they don’t waste half or more of the donations on bureaucracy and directors and what they actually mean for the people they claim to help. To many NGO’s are money making machines and we don’t want to support those “fake non-profits”.

All this will be discussed through governance in a DAO and completely transparent of course. Gnomes NFT holders will automatically be part of the DAO and have voting power.
